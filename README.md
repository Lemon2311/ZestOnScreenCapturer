This app was created when I wanted to create an Ai model that plays a game on BlueStacks(Android Emulator for using Android apps on Pc), and I faced the problem of not being able to get a decent fps with the existing libraries I found.<br><br>
Right now the app outputs the input recorded video in real time, and the current implementation of zest.py can be modified to use the video stream in any python app. <br><br>
note: The app needs to be visible on screen for Zest to work.
